### Enzyme-Home_assignment

## How to use

1- clone the repository using this link (https://github.com/mahmoud717/enzyme-test.git)
2- cd into the cloned repo
3- run `npm install` to install all of the dependencies
4- run `npm start` to run the project in local server

## Note:

- All of the requirements requested are met, but I only had 2 hours to complete this assignment so I didn't have the time to figue out how to download the images with the html snippet.
